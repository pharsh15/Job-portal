ELECTION SIMULATION PROGRAM================================


To run the Election simulator you just have to double click on the "Assignment2.bat" 
file which will open a command window with the program running.

Once it is running you will need to enter:
- Number of booths (2 or more)
- Number of voters (1 or more)
- Number of officers (between 1 and number of booths you entered)
- Number of candidates (1 or more)

after you have entered valid number for all the election simulation will run and display
when a booth generates a vote, when an officer registers a vote, and the final output will
show the poll results for all candidates and who won. If there is more than one winner then
it will show them as a draw.

one the program is finished running, you will be prompted as to whether you want to restart the
program or not. You can either type 'y' and hit enter to restart the program or if you press anything
else and hit enter to close the cmd window.
